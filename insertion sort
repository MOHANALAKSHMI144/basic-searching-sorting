Algorithm for insertion sort

Start with the second element(index 1,) as the 
first element is alredy "sorted"
Compare the current element with the elements before it.
Shift all larger elements one position to the right.
Insert the current element in the poisition.
Repeat for all elements in the list.

# Insertion Sort Pseudocode

function insertionSort(list):
  for i = 1 to length(list) - 1:
    key = list[i]
    j = i - 1

    while j >= 0 AND list[j] > key:
      list[j + 1] = list[j]
      j = j - 1

    list[j + 1] = key
    return list
